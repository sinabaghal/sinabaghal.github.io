I am a data scientist, quantitative analyst, and former mathematician with a passion for applying my expertise in data science and quantitative finance. My professional experience includes roles as a data scientist, machine learning researcher, and quantitative analyst.

I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2021, and I hold both a master's and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. My [PhD research](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16872) focused on Stochastic Optimization, while my earlier studies delved into Fundamental Mathematics.

I thrive on solving meaningful challenges and enjoy collaborating with diverse and talented teams. Feel free to reach out â€“ I'm always up for a coffee and a good conversation!

## Projects 

- Generative Modeling of Heston Volatility Surfaces Using Variational Autoencoders

This project focuses on training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to produce Heston volatility surfaces. The Heston model is a widely used stochastic volatility option pricing model. Once trained, this VAE can generate new volatility surfaces, which could be useful for various financial applications such as risk management, pricing exotic derivatives, etc. You can find the code for this project [**here**](https://github.com/sinabaghal/VariationalAutoEncoderforHeston).
