Exotic options have payoffs that depend on the path taken by the underlying asset. Exotic options include:

- Barrier options (e.g., up & out)
- Lookback options
- Asian options

[Exotic Options note](https://sinabaghal.github.io/files/notes/exotic_options_notes.pdf) provides further details on the pricing of these options based on geometric Brownian motion assets.
