I am a data scientist, quantitative analyst, and former mathematician with a passion for applying my expertise in data science and quantitative finance. My professional experience includes roles as a data scientist, machine learning researcher, and quantitative analyst.

I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2021, and I hold both a master's and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. My [PhD research](https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/16872) focused on Stochastic Optimization, while my earlier studies delved into Fundamental Mathematics.

# Projects 

### Generative Modeling of Heston Volatility Surfaces Using Variational Autoencoders

This project focuses on training a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to produce Heston volatility surfaces. The Heston model is used in stochastic volatility option pricing models. Once trained, this VAE can generate new volatility surfaces, which could be useful for various financial applications such pricing exotic derivatives. You can find the code for this project [**here**](https://github.com/sinabaghal/VariationalAutoEncoderforHeston). To see project's page, click [**here**](https://sinabaghal.github.io/vae4heston/).

### Implementing Deep Smoothing for Implied Volatility Surfaces (IVS)

This project is a python-based implementation of the methodologies presented in the paper *Deep Smoothing of the Implied Volatility Surface* by Ackerer et al (2020) [^1].  A volatility surface is a representation of implied volatility across different strike prices and maturities, crucial for pricing and hedging options accurately. Ensuring the surface is arbitrage-free is essential to prevent inconsistencies that could lead to riskless profit opportunities, which would undermine the modelâ€™s reliability in real markets. **You can find the code for this project** [**here**](https://github.com/sinabaghal/deepsmoothigIVS).

## Solution Manual to Stochastic for Finance II

Once upon a time, I became interested in quantitaive finance, in particular Option Pricing. Stochastic models are used for option pricing where the underlying uncertainly is driven by a class of continou time martingales known as [**Wiener processes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_process). The classic source for learning about options and how they are priced is Stochastic Calculus for Finance II written by Shreve. I compiled my own solutions to all of this book's exercises and you could find them [**here**](https://sinabaghal.github.io/shreve/).
