I am a data scientist, quantitative analyst, and former mathematician with a passion for applying my expertise in data science and quantitative finance. My professional experience includes roles as a data scientist, machine learning researcher, and quantitative analyst.

I earned my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Waterloo in 2021, and I hold both a master's and a bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Sharif University of Technology. My PhD research focused on Stochastic Optimization, while my earlier studies delved into Fundamental Mathematics.

I thrive on solving meaningful challenges and enjoy collaborating with diverse and talented teams. Feel free to reach out â€“ I'm always up for a coffee and a good conversation!
