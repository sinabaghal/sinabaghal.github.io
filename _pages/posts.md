## Quantitaive finance

### Exotic options 

Exotic options have payoffs that depend on the path taken by the underlying asset, making them path-dependent. Exotic options based on geometric Brownian motion assets include:

- Barrier options (e.g., up \& out)
- Lookback options
- Asian options

Exotic Option note provides further details on the pricing of these options.
